            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! My name is Matt Gibbons and I am a Front-End Developer based in Kingston, New York. At 30 years old, I decided to self-teach myself web development and jump into a new career.</p>
            <p>I graduated from SUNY Cortland in 2015 with a Bachelors' Degree in Sport Management and realized working in sports wasn't the direction I wanted to go. After a few years of bouncing between jobs and not having that feeling of being fulfilled career wise, I dove right in and dedicated my time to learning Front-End Development.</p>
            <p>In my free time I enjoy the misery of being a Mets, Islanders, and very randomly, a Tennessee Titans fan. Don't ask me why the Titans because I have no clue! Besides watching sports, I also like to play them recreationally, working out has recently become a passion, checking out different breweries, and of course a nice binge session of a show.</p>
